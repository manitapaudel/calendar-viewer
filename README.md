<h1 align="center"> :spiral_calendar: Calendar Viewer </h1>

## Introduction 
Looks like a calendar, is a calendar, but it is not just a regular calendar. Hope I was calendar, *ahem* sorry, hope I was **clear**.

#### In this calendar, as a calendar, you can:
-  view the current month and year, along with the days of the week
-  navigate to the previous and next months by clicking on buttons or arrows
-  see the current day of the month highlighted

#### But as a calendar, that is more than just a calendar, you can:
- create events that you would like to remember
- see the days with the events highlighted, and click on them to view them in detail
- edit the event as per your need
- or even delete them, if you feel like it; it's really your choice you know
- but, please be assured, your events are safe; they will be there when you close the calendar and open it next time. :)

> *It is responsive on various screen sizes too.*
