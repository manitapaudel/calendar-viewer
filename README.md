## Introduction 
Looks like a calendar, is a calendar, but it is not just a regular calendar. Hope I was calendar, *ahem* sorry, hope I was **clear**.

In this calendar, you can:
-  view the current month and year, along with the days of the week
-  navigate to the previous and next months by clicking on buttons or arrows
-  see the current day of the month highlighted
